# open_house_sign
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, so I designed an elegant iOS App which takes the “Open House” address and displays the optimal locations for placing the Signs. The product value is centered around the intelligence in the placement algorithm to help achieve end user goals. 


Name: 

Signs = Traffic = Leads

Inspiration:

My mom is a realtor and I helped her with a couple of open houses. My job was to place “Open House” signs at strategic places to maximize foot traffic to the house and increase leads. The problem though is, where do you place the “Open House” signs in order to achieve Signs = Traffic = Leads!
Did you know there are around 2 million active licensed realtors, each hosting around 24-30 open houses per year on an average across the US resulting in approximately 4-8 leads per home. Well, that is ~500 million potential deals each worth 3-6% commission on average. That is a multi-billion $ potential impact per year that we are talking about.
I always have been thinking about doing something about it but, High School workload, Volunteering and Tennis kept me busy. HSHacks IV is a perfect opportunity and huge motivator to take some action!

What it does:

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, so I designed an elegant iOS App which takes the “Open House” address and displays the optimal locations for placing the Signs. The product value is centered around the intelligence in the placement algorithm to help achieve end user goals. 

How we built it:

Used Swift 4 with UIViews integrated with Google Maps. The placement algorithm invokes geonames.org APIs to implement an early version of the placement algorithm.

Challenges we ran into:

I see challenges as opportunities. It was an opportunity for me to build my very first iOS app and I have some python programming experience.
o Learned Swift4 from scratch - OOPs, view controllers, multi-threading, Xcode, CocoaPods,  etc
o My first venture into the world of APIs - WHAT/WHY, API Keys, limits, constraints, security, JSON handling, HTTP/S and much more
o Realized the cradle-to-grave product lifecycle and the importance of each phase including endless debugging and testing to get the damn thing working! 
o Actually, the first challenge was to understand and talk to the users and do reasonable research in a relatively short span of time to build and deliver product to user expectations
Accomplishments that we're proud of
An intuitive iOS App that is pretty much ready for beta users. Eager to take it to the App Store to get early user feedback so that I can prioritize incremental features and keep the cycle going!

What we learned:

Programming can be fun! Ideation to a building end-user tangible product is rewarding. Hackathons breeds enthusiasm encourages collaboration and inspires creativity. This is my first Hackathon! Kudos to the organizers, it is motivating.

What's next:

The iOS App is functional. However, there are a ton of features that can be added based on the user feedback and priority.
o improve placement algorithm to include safety concerns, accessibility for drop-off/pick-up, peer input, community constraints, city ordinances & guidelines, traffic patterns, road directions, integrate other databases, suggest appropriate directional or turn signs, factor parks, identify best routes/entrance and much more to increase the reliability and accuracy
o apply AI/ML techniques on relevant data to deliver insights and build an intelligent system
o panoramic view integration
o virtual “Home Sign” tour
o social elements to enable realtor community
o dashboard and reporting
o much much more...

Built With:

Swift4, Xcode, Google Maps API, geonames.org API
